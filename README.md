# MemLabs Lab 4: Obsession - Shadows of the Deleted

## 📋 Challenge Overview

Lab 4 "Obsession" from MemLabs tests an analyst's willingness to go beyond default outputs and dig deep into memory artifacts. 
This challenge focuses on advanced process analysis, malware detection, and forensic interpretation of a Windows 7 SP1 memory dump.

## Objectives
- Identify and analyze malicious processes in memory
- Detect code injection and process hollowing techniques
- Uncover persistence mechanisms and evasion tactics
- Extract hidden artifacts and recover deleted data
- Demonstrate advanced memory forensics methodology

## 📊 Challenge Details

Challenge Name: Obsession: Shadows of the Deleted
Memory Dump: MemLabs-Lab4.7z
Target System: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit
Source: MemLabs Repository
Analysis Tool: Volatility 3 Framework 2.26.0
Environment: Kali Linux

## 🔍 Analysis Phases
### ✅ Phase 1: Process Mapping & Initial Reconnaissance
### Status: Complete | Duration: In Progress

### Key Findings Summary:

Lab 4 “Obsession” tests the analyst’s willingness to go beyond default outputs. It’s not about running a plugin — it’s about interpreting memory like a puzzle, obsessing over fragments of deleted data, and pushing every forensic tool to the limit. If you're not ready to dig deep, you won’t find the truth.

## 🧩 Phase 1: Image Info + Process Mapping

## 💾 1. `pslist`

→ The `pslist` plugin is one of the **most fundamental commands in memory forensics** using Volatility.

`pslist` enumerates **active processes** by scanning the **EPROCESS** structures in the memory dump. It's a way of peeking into the **process list the OS kept in memory when the snapshot was taken**.

### **Command**

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab4.raw windows.pslist
```

## Findings

### 1. High COUNT of Threads on **`svchost.exe`** [PID - 864]

![image.png](image%201.png)

- A typical **`svchost.exe`** instance runs **10–150 threads**, depending on the services it hosts.
- Having **900+ threads** in a single instance is not only unusual but likely points to:
    - **Malware injection**
    - **Process hollowing**
    - **Thread spraying** (evasion tactic)
    - **Rootkit or persistence technique**
    - Possibly **a memory exhaustion DoS vector**

### 2. Extremely Low **`dwm.exe`** **handles**

![image.png](image%202.png)

- Normally, `dwm.exe` [Desktop Windows Manager] spawns **once**, and holds **several hundred handles** and dozens of threads.
- We have **two instances**, **both with only 1 and 2 handles respectively**, and very low thread counts:
    - PID `1908`: 77 threads
    - PID `3000`: 76 threads

This is **highly atypical**, especially since they're spawned under the same parent (PID 840 `svchost.exe`) — even more suspicious because `svchost` is already a candidate for malware injection.

**SUSPICIOUS** because;

1. **TWO dwm.exe processes** (should only be one!)
2. **Handle counts too low** (76-77 vs expected 200-800+)
3. **Different sessions** (1 and 2)

**This Suggests:**

- **Process hollowing** (legitimate process replaced with malware)
- **Process impersonation** (malware pretending to be dwm.exe)
- **Possible rootkit activity**

This is **highly atypical**, especially since they're spawned under the same parent (PID 840 `svchost.exe`) — even more suspicious because `svchost` is already a candidate for malware injection.

## 2. ☠️ `malfind`

→ Volatility plugin that detects signs of code injection and malware in process memory by looking for suspicious memory regions with executable code.

**What it finds:**

- Injected code in processes
- Shellcode and malware
- Executable memory regions that seem suspicious etc.

### **Command:**

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab4.raw windows.malfind
```

## Findings:

### TEXTBOOK case of **malware injection** and process hollowing

![image.png](image%203.png)

![image.png](image%204.png)

![image.png](image%205.png)

All three processes have the **EXACT SAME** malicious code:

assembly

```bash
mov r10d, 0x80/0x81/0x82    ← System call numbers
movabs rax, 0x7fefe93a138   ← SAME address in all processes
jmp qword ptr [rax]         ← Jump to malicious code
nop                         ← Padding
```

### **Classic Injection Indicators:**

- **PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE** permissions (HUGE red flag!)
- **VadS** (Private memory allocation)
- **Same hex pattern**: `41 ba 80 00 00 00 48 b8 38 a1 93 fe fe 07 00 00`

### **Targeted Processes:**

- **`explorer.exe`** (PID 1944, 3012) - Windows Shell
- **`dllhost.exe`** (PID 2076) - COM + surrogate

### **What the attacker probably did:**

**Step 1: Process Hollowing**

- Injected malicious code into **legitimate processes**
- Replaced original code with **shellcode stubs**

**Step 2: System Call Hooking**

- `mov r10d, 0x80/0x81/0x82` → **System call numbers**
- `0x7fefe93a138` → **Shared malicious handler address**
- **Intercepts system calls** to hide activity

**Step 3: Persistence**

- Multiple processes → **redundancy**
- If one is killed, others continue

## 3. 📠 `cmdline`

Extracts and displays the command line arguments that were used to start each process, and exactly how each program was launched with what parameters and switches.

### **Command**

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab4.raw windows.cmdline
```

## Findings

![image.png](image%206.png)

```bash
2976    taskhost.exe    "taskhost.exe"                
1804    taskhost.exe    "taskhost.exe"         

# vs normal taskhost should look like:
taskhost.exe {243F5DED-C140-47D9-B005-B07948B2A976}
```

**→ `taskhost.exe` (PID 1804 and 2976) - Missing the `k` parameter pattern.**

- **Real taskhost.exe** manages scheduled tasks with **specific task GUIDs**
- **This one** just has `"taskhost.exe"` in quotes - **no actual task management!**
- It's **masquerading** as a legitimate Windows service

**Suspicions:**

1. **Two taskhost.exe processes** (unusual)
2. **No task GUIDs or parameters** (fake)
3. **Simple quoted executable name** (lazy impersonation)
4. **Different sessions** (1 and 2) but same behavior

**This suggests:**

- **Process impersonation** - malware pretending to be taskhost.exe
- **Lazy coding** - attacker didn't bother with realistic parameters
- **Multi-session persistence** - running in both user sessions

```bash
1944    explorer.exe    C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE         
2076    dllhost.exe     /Processid:{76D0CB12-7604-4048-B83C-1005C7DDC503}
2728    winlogon.exe    winlogon.exe                    
2976    taskhost.exe    "taskhost.exe"                  
3000    dwm.exe         "C:\Windows\system32\Dwm.exe"   
3012    explorer.exe    C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE         
```

### **The "`.EXE`" vs "`.exe`" Case Anomaly:**

**Windows is case-insensitive BUT;**

- **Real processes** typically show **consistent casing**
- **Registry entries** and **system calls** preserve original case
- **Malware** often has **different case patterns**

```bash
# Legitimate process creation preserves system casing
CreateProcess("C:\Windows\explorer.exe", ...)

# Malware might use different casing
CreateProcess("C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE", ...)  ← Hardcoded by attacker
```

### INSIGHTs:

The attacker got **lazy** or used an **automated tool** that doesn't properly mimic Windows process startup behavior. **Real Windows processes** have **rich command-line parameters**, while **malware processes** just have **basic executable paths**.

- **Real Windows processes** have **complex command-line arguments**
- **Malware** just uses **simple quoted paths** or **bare executable names**
- **No effort** to mimic legitimate process behavior

The attacker created **fake system processes** but didn't research how they **actually start**. They just copied the **executable names** without the **proper command-line arguments**.

**This is why the `-k` parameter is like a "digital fingerprint"** - it separates **real Windows processes** from **malware impersonation.**

It's a **fundamental Windows internals concept** that many attackers overlook.

## 4. 🧬 `dlllist`

→ Shows all the Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) loaded into each process's memory space - reveals what code libraries and functions each program is using.

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab4.raw windows.dlllist
```

## Findings

![image.png](image%207.png)

**Duplicate Explorer Process**

- One is **3012**, and the other explorer.exe was PID **1944**
- **Having multiple explorer.exe processes is highly unusual** and often indicates:
    - Process replacement/hollowing
    - Malware masquerading as explorer.exe
    - System instability or compromise

**Suspicious Timing Pattern**

- All DLLs load at exactly `2019-06-29 07:29:36.000000 UTC` initially
- This is **8 seconds after the dwm.exe** process we analyzed earlier
- Uniform timestamps across all initial DLLs suggest **batch loading** rather than organic process startup

**Missing VirtualBox Components**

- **Notable absence**: No `VBoxMRXNP.dll` like in the first explorer.exe (PID 1944)
- This suggests different execution contexts or potential masquerading

**Extensive Network/HTTP Components**
Additional network components not seen in first explorer:

- `WINHTTP.dll` - HTTP client functionality
- `webio.dll` - Web I/O operations
- Various wireless and network APIs loaded

**Delayed Fax Services Loading**

- Fax-related DLLs (`fxsst.dll`, `FXSAPI.dll`, `FXSRESM.DLL`) load at `07:29:47`
- **11-second delay** after initial loading - unusual for standard explorer

**HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS**: Multiple explorer.exe processes running simultaneously is a **major red flag**. This pattern commonly indicates:

1. **Process Hollowing**: Malware replacing legitimate explorer.exe
2. **Persistence Mechanism**: Malware maintaining presence via fake explorer
3. **System Compromise**: Unauthorized process execution

## 5. 🌐 `getsids`

→  Its **a plugin used in the Volatility framework for memory analysis, which prints the SIDs (Security Identifiers) owning each process.** SIDs are unique values used to identify a trustee, such as a user or group, and are crucial for understanding the privileges and identities of processes in a system's memory. 

### **Command:**

```bash
vol -f MemoryDump_Lab4.raw windows.getsids
```

### Findings:

![image.png](image%209.png)

**User Account Names**

- **"eminem" (RID 1000)** - This appears to be a non-standard administrative username, which is unusual for a typical corporate environment
- **"SlimShady" (RID 1001)** - This is clearly suspicious as it references Eminem's alter ego and suggests unauthorized account creation

**Privilege Escalation Indicators**

- The "eminem" user has **Administrator privileges** (S-1-5-32-544), which may indicate privilege escalation
- Both users are running multiple processes with interactive logon sessions

**Unusual Process Execution**

- **DumpIt.exe (PID 2624)** running under the "eminem" account with **High Mandatory Level** (S-1-16-12288) - This is a memory dumping tool, which could indicate:
    - Legitimate forensic analysis
    - Malicious memory extraction for credential harvesting
    - Anti-forensics attempts

**Multiple Active Sessions**

- Two separate user sessions are active simultaneously (eminem and SlimShady)
- This could indicate:
    - Session hijacking
    - Unauthorized concurrent access
    - Lateral movement between accounts

**Timing Concerns**

- The presence of GoogleCrashHandler processes suggests recent system activity
- StikyNot.exe (Sticky Notes) running under SlimShady account indicates active user interaction
